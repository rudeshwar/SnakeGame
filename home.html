            The Snake game is a classic video game where the player controls a snake that 
            moves around the screen, eating food items and growing longer with each item consumed. 
            The objective of the game is to make the snake as long as possible without running into
             the walls of the game area or colliding with itself. Here's a more detailed description:

            <b>Gameplay</b>: The player uses the arrow keys (or other designated keys) to control the 
            direction of the snake's movement: up, down, left, or right. The snake continuously moves 
            in the direction of the last key pressed by the player.

           <b> Objective:</b> The main goal is to eat as many food items as possible, which appear randomly on the 
            screen. Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows longer. 
            The score increases based on the number of food items consumed.

           <b> Challenges: </b> <br>

    <b>Self-Collision:</b> As the snake grows longer, it becomes more challenging to avoid running into its own body.<br>
   <b> Wall Collision:</b> In many versions of the game, if the snake runs into the walls of the game area, the game ends.<br>
    <b>Speed Increase:</b> In some versions, the snake's speed increases as the game progresses, making it harder to control.
